        <p>Visual Studio Code is an app in which we can code many languages like java, python etc. It is free to use and can be downloaded from any web browser for Windows, MacOS and Linux. There are some inbuilt features in it which helps in coding more and more.</p>

        <p>Console Screen is a screen which is not visible in the main web browser. It helps in finding what the error is while making a web page. We can open it by right clicking on the web page, then clicking on the "Inspect" option and then clicking on the "Console" option. We can write anything in console by "console.log("xyz");". For a variable in console we do not need to put double inverted commas and for coming like a name we need to put double inverted comma.</p>

            var first_name = "Pujan";
            var last_name = "Mehta";
            var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var a = 10;
            var b = 5;
            var add = a + b;
            console.log(add);

            var sub = a - b;
            console.log(sub);

            var multi = a * b;
            console.log(multi);

            var div = a / b;
            console.log(div);
